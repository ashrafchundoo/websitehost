<p>

This special issue is focused on sustainable marketing but from a unique viewpoint: those organizations campaigning for social justice in some way through their marketing actions. It would be good to receive papers from interested AM colleagues that intersect with their own interests and the theme of the special issue. To see the full call for papers, see:<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/special_issues/sustainable_marketing_and_civic_engagement_business_campaigns_for_social_justice">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/special_issues/sustainable_marketing_and_civic_engagement_business_campaigns_for_social_justice</a>
<br>
Please note the following areas would be most relevant:

• Organisations’ use of and/or campaigning for civil rights and social justice as a means to differentiate themselves in their sustainability practices and marketing;
• Organisational use of cause-related, public issue, and political marketing campaigns;
• Organisational reactions to public outcries related to perceived ethical breaches of marketing and unsustainable marketing activities;
• Organisations’ use of technological tools as a means of tackling sustainable practices of consumption and disposal.

The deadline is August 2021. If anyone wishes to discuss a potential paper, please contact Dr Navdeep Athwal by <a href="navdeep.athwal@leicester.ac.uk">clicking this link</a>

	<h1>The 9th ICSR conference has been postponed to 2022</h1>
	<p>
		Written by Admin on April 1, 2020. Posted in 9th ICSR

As we are uncertain about how long the Covid 19 situation will last, and whether travel bans will be lifted, and because the health and wellbeing of our network is a priority, we have decided to postpone this years’ conference by one year. 

 

The 9th ICSR conference will therefore now be in 2022. It will take place at Mid Sweden University, Östersund, Sweden on the 15 and 16 September 2022. If you have submitted abstracts you may want to revise these or progress them, and we’ll give you details about next years’ submission dates on the website. 

 

We would like to thank our colleagues Anna Sorensson, Besraf Tesfaye, Anders Lundström, Maria Bogren for all the efforts they have already made to organise the conference in Sweden, and for their flexibility to host our conference in 2022.

 

We will release communications about the next conference on our website, but in the meantime if you have any questions do contact us.

 

Stay safe.
